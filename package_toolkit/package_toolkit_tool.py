package_toolkit.py

This script packages all tools in the FreelanceScripts project into a single zip archive, while respecting exclusion rules and generating a combined README. 

Key Features:
- Recursively scans the project for tool directories and files.
- Excludes files/folders based on patterns and `.excluded` marker files.
- Dynamically generates a combined README summarizing all included tools.
- Packages everything into an `output/freelance_toolkit.zip` archive.

Intended as a learning resource: code is heavily commented to explain each step and concept.
